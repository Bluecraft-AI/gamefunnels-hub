# Game Funnels Hub

This repository serves as the main hub for the Game Funnels collection of retro-inspired browser games, hosted at [run.gamefunnels.ai](http://run.gamefunnels.ai).

## Available Games

- [Stick Fighter](http://run.gamefunnels.ai/stick-fighter/) - A Windows XP-themed stick figure fighting game with local multiplayer.

## How It Works

This repository is set up as the main GitHub Pages site for the custom domain `run.gamefunnels.ai`. Individual games are hosted in separate repositories and are accessible as subpaths of the main domain.

## Adding New Games

To add a new game to the collection:

1. Create a new repository for the game
2. Enable GitHub Pages for that repository
3. Do NOT add a CNAME file to the game repository
4. Update this hub's index.html to include a link to the new game

## Development

The hub page is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Feel free to improve the design or add new features to enhance the game collection experience.
